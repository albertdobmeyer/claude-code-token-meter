**A speedometer for your context window.** Zero dependencies. Single file. Answers one question: *should I reset my context right now?*

AI coding agents bill linearly per token — but session cost grows **quadratically, not just linearly**, because every turn resends the entire history. A 100-turn conversation doesn't cost 10× a 10-turn one. It costs roughly **50×**. And reasoning quality degrades well before the context window actually fills — the model attends more weakly to the middle of a long conversation than to its start and recent tail, so drift sets in long before you hit any limit. Most developers have no real-time visibility into either.

Agent Token Meter watches your coding agent's session and shows you the burn rate, acceleration, and estimated calls until auto-compaction — so you know *when* to curate a handoff and reset, not just how much you've spent after the fact.

The headline is the **×N.N multiplier** — how much each call costs vs. a fresh-conversation call. ×1–×2 green, ×3 yellow, ×4+ red, ×5+ red background. The second line is a phase banner that fuses status (BUILD/HANDOFF/CLEAR), context fill, and reset ETA into one scannable sentence. When context exceeds the usable limit you see `⚠ HANDOFF AND CLEAR — context N% OVER · reset overdue Nm` instead.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Status | Session logs |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Supported | `~/.claude/projects/{project}/{session}.jsonl` |
| **Cursor** | Planned | — |
| **Windsurf** | Planned | — |

Adding a new agent requires only a profile object and a parser function. See the `AGENTS` object in `token-meter.mjs`.

## Install

The fastest path (no install at all — recommended):

```bash
npx agent-token-meter
```

`npx` downloads and runs the latest version on demand. Re-runs use a local cache. Nothing pollutes your global packages.

If you'd rather have the command available system-wide:

```bash
npm i -g agent-token-meter
agent-token-meter            # now runs from anywhere
```

> **Note:** the npm landing page suggests `npm i agent-token-meter` (without `-g`). That command works, but because this is a CLI-only package it just drops the binary into `./node_modules/.bin/` of whatever directory you're in — your shell won't find it on PATH. Use `npx` or the global install above instead.

To clone and run directly from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertdobmeyer/agent-token-meter
cd agent-token-meter
node token-meter.mjs
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+ (zero dependencies).

## Threshold hooks (agent integration)

The token meter can nudge your AI agent directly inside the conversation. Instead of polling or injecting on every turn, it uses **threshold triggers** — the agent gets a one-line system reminder only when context crosses a reasoning-degradation boundary. The 50/75/90% marks correspond to *curation is still cheap*, *drift is setting in*, and *attention degraded — cost biting hard*. Zero tokens injected when below those marks.

### Install hooks

```bash
npx agent-token-meter --install-hooks
```

This copies a lightweight hook script to `~/.claude/hooks/` and registers it as a `PostToolUse` hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The hook fires after every tool call but **stays silent unless a threshold is crossed**.

Currently supported for: **Claude Code**.

### What the agent sees

| Threshold | Nudge |
|---|---|
| **50%** | `[Token Meter] Context 50%. Reasoning still sharp — start drafting the handoff (decisions, constraints, open threads).` |
| **75%** | `[Token Meter] Context 75%. Drift zone — finish the handoff file now while curation is still cheap. Prepare to /clear.` |
| **90%** | `[Token Meter] Context 90%. ~$X.XX/call tax + attention degrading. /clear and reload from the handoff — don't let /compact summarize under pressure.` |
| **Compaction** | `[Token Meter] Compaction detected (Nx). Context reset to X%. Position bias reset to fresh; thresholds re-armed.` |

Each threshold fires **once per session**. When auto-compaction happens, thresholds above the new fill level are re-armed. The nudges aren't budget alarms — they're cues at the points where the cost of *not* curating starts to outweigh the cost of curating.

### How it works

The hook script (`~/.claude/hooks/token-meter-hook.mjs`) runs in ~20ms:

1. Finds the active session JSONL file
2. Parses it for current context size and model
3. Computes fill % against the model's context limit
4. Checks against thresholds stored in a tiny state file
5. If no threshold crossed — exits silently (no output, zero tokens injected)
6. If a threshold is crossed — emits one line via `additionalContext`

State is tracked in `~/.claude/token-meter-hook-state.json` to prevent re-firing.

### Uninstall hooks

```bash
npx agent-token-meter --uninstall-hooks
```

Removes the hook script, state file, and settings entry. Your existing hooks are preserved.

### Two tools, two purposes

| | Dashboard (`npx agent-token-meter`) | Hooks (`--install-hooks`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | You (the developer) | The AI agent |
| **Display** | Full real-time dashboard in split terminal | One-line system reminder |
| **Frequency** | Continuous live updates | Only at 50/75/90% thresholds |
| **Token cost** | Zero (separate process) | ~4 lines total across entire session |
| **Purpose** | Spot the curation moment, monitor burn rate | Nudge the agent to curate a handoff at reasoning-degradation moments |

Use both together: the dashboard for your situational awareness, the hooks for the agent's.

## Agent Protocol — the contract between hook and agent

The threshold hook fires a one-line system reminder. That reminder is *imperative* but compact — and a frontier model has to infer the rest: what to write, where to save it, what to tell the human at 90%, how the next session should pick up. v1.4 closes that gap with a bundled **Agent Protocol** document.

### What it is

`AGENT-PROTOCOL.md` is a one-page markdown file that lives at the project root. It tells the agent exactly:

- The **handoff file schema** (7 sections: Mission, Constraints, Decisions, Open threads, Next step, Files touched, Avoid)
- The **filename convention** (`./handoff-{shortId}.md`)
- The **exact phrase to say to the user at 90%** ("Please run `/clear`, then reload by saying: 'continue from ./handoff-{id}.md'")
- The **fallback procedure** when auto-compaction fires anyway (write a fresh handoff from post-compaction state)
- The **bootstrap protocol** when a fresh session sees a prior handoff (read it first, confirm with user, then resume)
- An optional **handoff-vs-memory decision rubric** for projects using Claude Code's auto-memory system

### How to install

```bash
# Full setup — protocol file + CLAUDE.md import line
npx agent-token-meter --install-protocol

# Just the protocol file, no CLAUDE.md edit
npx agent-token-meter --install-protocol --no-claude-md

# Print the protocol to stdout for piping (zero side effects)
npx agent-token-meter --emit-agent-protocol | clip   # Windows
npx agent-token-meter --emit-agent-protocol | pbcopy # macOS

# Combined install — hooks + protocol in one command
npx agent-token-meter --install-hooks --install-protocol

# Remove cleanly
npx agent-token-meter --uninstall-protocol
```

When you run `--install-protocol`, the meter writes `AGENT-PROTOCOL.md` into your project root and adds a single import line to your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
<!-- agent-token-meter:protocol-start -->
## Token meter protocol
This project uses agent-token-meter. Read @AGENT-PROTOCOL.md and follow it when you see `[Token Meter]` system reminders.
<!-- agent-token-meter:protocol-end -->
```

Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` and follows `@imports`, so the protocol lands in the agent's context at session start — and survives `/compact` because CLAUDE.md is re-injected from disk after compaction.

### What changes for the agent

Without the protocol, the 75% nudge says *"finish the handoff file now"* — the agent has to invent what "the handoff file" contains. With the protocol installed, the agent reads the document at session start and knows the 7-section schema, the filename convention, and the exact request-to-clear phrasing. The nudges themselves remain compact; they reference the protocol but don't repeat it.

### What changes for the human

The setup cost is one command. After that, an ideal session looks like:

1. You start a session and ignore the meter for the first 50% of context
2. At 50%, the agent (not you) recognizes the nudge and begins drafting `./handoff-{shortId}.md`
3. At 75%, the agent finalizes the file
4. At 90%, the agent stops, confirms the handoff is complete, and tells you the literal phrase to use: *"Please run /clear, then reload by saying: 'continue from ./handoff-{id}.md'"*
5. You run `/clear` and reload as instructed
6. The next session's `SessionStart` hook fires a one-line read-this-first nudge pointing at the handoff
7. The agent reads the handoff, confirms with you, and resumes exactly where it left off

If you never read the README mid-session — that's the design goal.

### Multi-event hooks

Installing hooks in v1.4 registers three event handlers, not just one:

| Event | What we do |
|---|---|
| `PostToolUse` | Existing threshold nudges (50/75/90%) and heuristic compaction detection |
| `SessionStart` | Bootstrap-from-handoff nudge if a recent `./handoff-*.md` is found in cwd |
| `PostCompact` | Explicit compaction nudge with re-arm + fresh-handoff instruction |

Older Claude Code versions that don't fire `SessionStart` or `PostCompact` fall back to the heuristic path — no breakage, just slightly lazier signal timing.

## Usage

Run in a **split terminal pane** alongside your coding agent:

```bash
# Scoped to current project by default — watches sessions in this cwd only
npx agent-token-meter

# Watch any session machine-wide (pre-1.2 behavior)
npx agent-token-meter --all-projects

# List sessions active in the last 10 min (scoped to cwd unless --all-projects)
npx agent-token-meter --sessions

# Lock to a specific session by short id or path (disables auto-follow)
npx agent-token-meter --session 32891718

# Pin to the initial session without auto-follow
npx agent-token-meter --no-follow

# Specify agent explicitly
npx agent-token-meter --agent claude-code

# List supported agents and detection status
npx agent-token-meter --agents

# List all sessions ever (cost summary)
npx agent-token-meter --all

# Filter by project name substring
npx agent-token-meter --project augustus-trading
```

### Which session is being watched?

The meter watches **one session at a time, scoped to your current working directory by default.** Launch it from `B:\A5DS-HQ\agent-token-meter` and it only considers sessions in that project — never a newer one from an unrelated repo. It derives the project directory from `cwd` using Claude Code's own naming scheme (replace `/`, `\`, `:` each with `-`: `B:\A5DS-HQ\agent-token-meter` → `B--A5DS-HQ-agent-token-meter`).

The dashboard header shows both the project directory name and the short session id:

```
Agent Token Meter v1.4.0 · Claude Code · B--A5DS-HQ-agent-token-meter · 6cfb4866
```

This is the primary disambiguation signal — you match the project string (with the drive letter and path segments) against your terminal's `cwd` to confirm the numbers belong to the conversation you're thinking about. The short session id is the tiebreaker if multiple terminals are open in the same project; Claude Code's `/status` command shows the same id.

A transient cyan line at the **bottom** of the dashboard cycles through 2–4 startup slides (each ~4–5s, then the line goes quiet) so the numbers above never shift:

| Slide | When it shows |
|---|---|
| `no sessions in cwd (<project>) · watching newest globally · --all-projects to keep this mode` | You launched from a directory with no Claude Code sessions — fell back to global scan |
| `watching: <cwd or project> · <short id>` | Always |
| `follow mode on · switches to newest in this project after 30s idle` | Default mode |
| `+N other active in this project · --sessions to list · --session <id> to pin` | Multiple sessions open in the same project |
| `new session segment · prior <id> (2.8MB, 26m ago) · metrics cover this segment only` | Claude Code just rolled over to a fresh `.jsonl` — a long conversation now lives across two files |
| `pinned to <id> · auto-follow off` | `--no-follow` or `--session` is active |
| `→ switched to <project> · <id>` | Auto-follow just jumped (one-shot notice) |

Escape hatches:

```bash
npx agent-token-meter --all-projects        # watch any session machine-wide
npx agent-token-meter --sessions            # list sessions active in last 10 min
npx agent-token-meter --session 6cfb4866    # lock to one by short id
npx agent-token-meter --no-follow           # pin to initial pick, never switch
```

### Multiple Claude Code terminals

With cwd-scoping, you can safely run one meter per project in separate terminal panes — they won't stomp on each other. Inside a single project, if you have two Claude Code instances running (e.g. a main chat and a sub-agent), auto-follow switches between them after 30 seconds of local idle on the current one. Cross-project switching only happens if you pass `--all-projects`.

**Orphan protection:** the meter polls `process.ppid` every 5 seconds and exits if the launching shell is gone. It also exits on stdin end/close. On Windows this fixes the long-standing problem where killing the `npx` wrapper leaves the grandchild `node.exe` running forever — closing your terminal now cleanly takes the meter down with it.

**For agents:** if your agent reads the meter output (e.g. via `tee` to a log file), it can compare the short session id in the header against its own session file to confirm the numbers belong to *its* conversation. A mismatch means the meter is watching a sibling session.

### Session rollovers

Claude Code doesn't always append a conversation to the same `.jsonl`. Starting a new session in the same `cwd` — via `/resume`, `claude --continue`, a fresh `claude` invocation, or recovery after a crash — opens a **new** session file that picks up from a handoff while the prior file sits stale on disk. The meter always watches one file at a time, so after a rollover it reports on the *new* segment only. A multi-hour conversation can briefly look like a short one until the new file grows.

The meter detects this pattern at startup and queues a slide so the scope isn't ambiguous:

```
new session segment · prior fa7a76de (2.8MB, 26m ago) · metrics cover this segment only
```

The slide fires when the current file has **≤5 user turns** *and* a sibling `.jsonl` **≥100KB** exists in the same project directory. No aggregation happens — the numbers stay faithful to the live file; the slide just makes the scope explicit. To inspect the prior segment, jump to it, or see cumulative cost across every segment:

```bash
npx agent-token-meter --sessions              # list recent sessions in this project
npx agent-token-meter --session fa7a76de      # lock to the prior segment
npx agent-token-meter --all                   # cost summary across every session in this project
```

### Terminal setup

**Windows Terminal:** Right-click tab > Split Pane > run the meter in the smaller pane.
**macOS/Linux:** `tmux split-window -h 'npx agent-token-meter'` or use iTerm2 split panes.
**VS Code:** Split terminal (Ctrl+Shift+5), run in the second pane.

## Why this exists

Most coding agents have some form of cost or context display, but none tell you the *rate of change* — which is what actually matters for making decisions. And none surface *reasoning-degradation cues* — the points where your context is filling not just expensively, but counterproductively.

| Question | Built-in | **Agent Token Meter** |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| How much have I spent? | Sometimes | **Yes** |
| How full is my context? | Sometimes | **Yes** |
| How fast is it filling? | | **Yes** |
| Is the rate increasing? | | **Yes** |
| When will compaction trigger? | | **Yes** |
| Did compaction happen? | | **Yes** |
| Am I past the drift zone (reasoning quality cliff)? | | **Yes** |
| Is now the right moment to curate a handoff? | | **Yes** |
| How much does my history cost per call? | | **Yes** |
| How much would resetting save me? | | **Yes** |
| Can the agent nudge itself at the curation moment? | | **Yes** |

## Reading the display

### ×N.N multiplier + phase banner (the headline)

```
 MULTIPLIER   ×7.6 ↑        $0.52 now   $0.04 fresh
 BUILD — productive zone · context 22% · reset in ~442
```

The headline answers the question "should I reset?" before anything else. The multiplier is `currentContext / baseline` — per-call cost ratio vs. a fresh conversation, displayed with one decimal of precision. The arrow tracks acceleration (`↑`/`=`/`↓`). `now` is the current per-call cost; `fresh` is what a fresh-conversation call would cost.

The phase banner compresses state + action into one sentence: phase name (EXPLORE / BUILD / HANDOFF / CLEAR), short rationale, context fill %, reset ETA. When context has already exceeded usable, the banner switches to `⚠ HANDOFF AND CLEAR — context N% OVER · reset overdue Nm`.

Color bands on the multiplier:
- **×1–×2** green — fresh or productive, nothing to do
- **×3** yellow — plan a handoff
- **×4+** red — conversation history is taxing you heavily
- **×5+** red background — stop and reset now

### NOW — what's the current state

```
 context      212.5k / 967.0k         22%
 burn         +1706 tok/call ↑
 last turn    212.5k in · 231 out · tool_use
```

- **context** — current context size / usable limit (model limit minus the 33k auto-compact buffer) + fill %.
- **burn** — average context growth per call over the last 10 calls. Arrow shows acceleration trend.
- **last turn** — latest API call's context, output tokens, and stop reason. Useful for spotting which turns are driving burn.

### IF YOU CLEAR — the actionable projection

```
 per call     save $0.27
 next 20      save ~$5.48
 steps        write handoff → /clear → reload with plan
```

- **per call** — what you'd save on every subsequent call by writing a ~2k handoff file and resetting.
- **next 20** — cumulative savings over the next 20 calls.
- **steps** — the workflow: dump a plan file, reset context, reload in a fresh session.

This section only appears when `/clear` would save more than ~$0.005/call — below that, it's silent to keep the dashboard quiet.

### SESSION — the post-game breakdown

```
 spend        $75.93 · 16 turns · 11h 55m · $6.36/hr
 cache        97% hit · saved $350.12 · 27.7M in · 286.2k out
 alt models   Sonnet 4.6 $15.19   Kimi K2.5 $5.35
```

- **spend** — total cost, user turn count, session duration, cost per hour.
- **cache** — hit rate, cache ROI (net savings from caching), total billed input/output tokens.
- **alt models** — what the same workload would have cost on other providers. Customize via config file.
- **last** — most recent API call's context size, output tokens, stop reason. Useful for debugging unexpected burn.

## How it works

Coding agents write conversation logs as JSONL files. Each API response includes a `usage` object:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 3,
  "output_tokens": 1247,
  "cache_creation_input_tokens": 2841,
  "cache_read_input_tokens": 89339
}
```

Agent Token Meter watches the active session file with `fs.watch` (falling back to polling), parses usage entries, and computes derived metrics: burn rate, acceleration, compaction prediction, and cost estimates.

A background scan every 3 seconds tracks which session is most recently active. If a different session starts growing and the current one has been idle for 30 s or more, the meter switches to it — so it follows you when you jump between Claude Code terminals. For the hook, Claude Code passes the session id and transcript path on stdin, so threshold state is tracked per session and concurrent instances don't suppress each other's nudges.

**It is strictly read-only.** It never modifies session files or interacts with any API.

## Pricing

Built-in rates (as of April 2026):

| Model | Input | Output | Cache Write | Cache Read | Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Opus 4.7** | $15/M | $75/M | $18.75/M | $1.50/M | 1M |
| **Opus 4.6** | $15/M | $75/M | $18.75/M | $1.50/M | 1M |
| **Sonnet 4.6** | $3/M | $15/M | $3.75/M | $0.30/M | 1M |
| **Haiku 4.5** | $0.80/M | $4/M | $1.00/M | $0.08/M | 200K |
| **Kimi K2.5** | $0.60/M | $3.00/M | $0.60/M | $0.15/M | 262K |
| **Kimi K2 Thinking** | $0.60/M | $2.50/M | $0.60/M | $0.15/M | 262K |

> Opus 4.7 rates mirror Opus 4.6 as a conservative default — Anthropic has kept Opus family pricing consistent. Override via `~/.claude/token-meter.json` if that changes.

### Custom providers

Add or override providers via config file (location depends on agent):

```json
{
  "compare": ["claude-sonnet-4-6", "kimi-k2.5", "my-provider"],
  "providers": {
    "my-provider": {
      "input": 1.0,
      "output": 5.0,
      "cacheWrite": 1.25,
      "cacheRead": 0.1,
      "context": 128000,
      "label": "My LLM"
    }
  }
}
```

## Why short sessions win

Two independent reasons to curate a handoff early instead of riding a long conversation into auto-compaction. Either one alone justifies the workflow; together they make it obvious.

### 1. Cumulative cost is quadratic, even when per-token pricing is flat

Providers bill linearly per token. But every agent message sends the **entire conversation history** as input, so the total tokens processed across N turns is `1 + 2 + … + N = N(N+1)/2`. That's quadratic in N, not linear — even though no pricing tier changed. The bite isn't in any single call's sticker; it's the cumulative drag of carrying history forward.

If each turn adds ~2k tokens of context:

| Turns | Context sent this turn | Cumulative input billed |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | 20k | 110k |
| 50 | 100k | 2.55M |
| 100 | 200k | 10.1M |

A 100-turn session bills ~50× a 10-turn one, not 10×. **Short sessions win even when nothing about the pricing tier changes.**

Prompt caching is a partial mitigant, not a refutation. Cached reads cost ~10% of fresh input ($1.50/M vs $15/M on Opus), so a session with a 97% cache hit rate runs at roughly a 10× discount on the input bill. But the *shape* doesn't change: per-call cost still grows linearly with `n` (you read the whole history every turn, even if cheaply), so cumulative spend stays O(n²) — just with a smaller coefficient. And the cache TTL is ~5 minutes; idle past that and you're paying full price on the next call.

The meter shows both sides honestly. The SESSION zone reports cache hit rate and net cache savings alongside the raw spend — so the discount is visible, but so is the underlying curve.

### 2. Reasoning quality degrades before recall does — and a curated handoff resets position bias

The single most important distinction in current long-context LLM behavior is the gap between **retrieval reach** and **active reasoning workspace** — these scale very differently. Modern frontier models (Opus 4.x, Sonnet 4.x) score near-perfect on needle-in-haystack benchmarks: they can quote anything from anywhere in a 1M-token window. But quoting is *referencing*, not *reasoning*. The active reasoning workspace — the slice over which the model maintains tight dependency tracking, global consistency, and coherent multi-step inference — is far smaller than the advertised context limit and degrades gradually as more material competes within it.

Gary Capps' article [*The Hidden Constraint in LLM Systems*](./the-hidden-constraint.md) (May 2026) frames this precisely: large context windows behave like **searchable memory feeding a constrained reasoning workspace**, not uniformly active thought. The folk "first paragraph + last few pages" intuition is oversimplified, but it's still closer to the truth than the marketed "1M-token thinking" framing — and the distinction it points at is about *reasoning*, not *referencing*. The article ships with the package as a reference; its pages-based table mapping active reasoning budget to expected competence (1–3 pages: excellent; 25–40 pages: degrading; 75+: mostly retrieval behavior) is the most useful operating-zone guide for production use we've seen. See [`CREDITS.md`](./CREDITS.md) for full attribution.

Two consequences matter especially for coding agents:

- **Generated output competes for the same budget.** A model producing a long answer, a large diff, or verbose tool output occupies the same active workspace the input material is using. The budget isn't just consumed by what you sent — it's also consumed by what the model is producing right now.
- **Dependency density matters more than raw size.** Ten pages of tightly-coupled code (variable relationships, cross-references, state transitions) stresses the workspace earlier than a hundred pages of loose reference docs. Coding sessions sit on the dense-dependency end of the curve.

Layered on top, the canonical "Lost in the Middle" effect (Liu et al. 2023; RULER and NoLiMa follow-ups) shows that *within* whatever reasoning workspace exists, attention is U-shaped — the start and recent tail are weighted heavily, the middle underweighted. For coding agents this shows up as drift, not amnesia: subtle departures from earlier constraints, half-remembered decisions, mounting "I forgot we already tried that" moments. The state you care about is buried in the region the model is already attending to least.

This is the sharper reason a curated handoff beats a long conversation — it isn't just shorter, it **resets position bias and recompacts the active workspace around what actually matters**. The decisions, constraints, and open threads you write down land at *position 0* in the fresh session, in the high-attention zone, and the workspace is no longer cluttered with dense interdependencies from a phase you've moved past. You're moving the important state back to where the model actually weighs it, in the form the model can actually use.

The actionable consequence: **operate in the competence zone, not the tolerance zone.** The lower end of any model's capability range is where it's reliable; the upper end is where it *occasionally* succeeds under favorable conditions. A curated handoff at 50–75% keeps you in the competence zone; riding to 90%+ and trusting `/compact` puts you in the tolerance zone.

### Why a written handoff beats `/compact`

`/compact` is opaque, lossy, and non-deterministic. A handoff file is the opposite:

- **Reviewable** — you read it before continuing
- **Diffable** — version-controllable alongside the code it describes
- **Deterministic** — same bootstrap every time you reload
- **Selective** — you choose what survives, not the model

There's a deeper problem with auto-compact, beyond the audit-trail argument: the model is summarizing its own conversation **under context pressure** — the exact moment its attention is most degraded. You're asking it to decide what matters at the moment it's least able to tell. A handoff you curate at 50–75% inverts this: you write the bootstrap while the agent's reasoning is still sharp, then reload into a fresh, position-bias-friendly session.

This is the engineering-artifact argument, and it stands independently of either claim above: even if a future model fully eliminated mid-context reasoning drift, a written handoff would still be the better way to start the next session — for the same reason a commit message is better than running `git diff` from memory.

### The operating discipline

Both arguments point at the same workflow: **short, deliberate sessions, with handoff documents you curate while your context is still sharp — not summaries the model improvises once its attention is already degraded.** Agent Token Meter exists to surface the moment when that curation is still cheap, via the real-time per-call multiplier and the 50/75/90% threshold nudges.

## Composing with Claude Code's memory system

Claude Code ships with a per-project auto-memory system — `MEMORY.md` plus detail files at `~/.claude/projects/{project}/memory/`. That system uses the **same architectural pattern** as agent-token-meter, applied at a different timescale:

|                              | agent-token-meter | Claude Code memory   |
|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Scope                        | Within-session    | Across-session       |
| Trigger to curate            | 50/75/90% fill    | Non-derivable facts  |
| What lands at position 0 next | The handoff file (next session) | MEMORY.md (every session) |
| Failure mode if you don't curate | `/compact` summarizes under pressure | Facts re-derived or lost |

The two are **complementary**, not overlapping:

- The handoff captures *in-flight task state* — relevant for one continuation, then archival
- Memory captures *durable, non-derivable knowledge* — relevant for every future session in this project

A sophisticated workflow uses both: at curation moments, sort what you're about to write down by lifespan. **If it would still be useful in a session three weeks from now in this same project, it's memory. If it's useful only for the next continuation, it's a handoff.** The bundled `AGENT-PROTOCOL.md` includes this rubric so the agent can apply it directly.

Both tools inherit the same underlying claim from Gary Capps' [*The Hidden Constraint in LLM Systems*](./the-hidden-constraint.md): **retrieval feeding a constrained reasoning workspace** is the design pattern, not a quirk of any one tool. The meter is the within-session version of what Claude Code's memory system does across sessions.
