# Changelog

All notable changes to **agent-token-meter** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **README dashboard examples updated to match the polished v1.4 output.** The PNG screenshot was refreshed in 1.4.0 but several text code-fences in the README still showed the pre-polish layout (multi-line `WHAT TO HANDOFF` widget, duplicated `[DRIFT]` zone tag on the multiplier line, `12 pages` overlay on the context line, `write handoff → /clear → reload with plan` step phrasing). Every example fence and explanatory paragraph now matches the actual dashboard output, including the new dual-signal phase banner (`fill N% (overhead M%)`), the single-canonical zone tag location, and the new `HANDOFF SECTIONS` section header.
- **"Which session is being watched?" example header** updated to show the new two-line clean form (`agent-token-meter · 6cfb4866` instead of the truncated encoded path).
- **Startup-slide table** updated — the `watching: <project> · <id>` row was removed in 1.4.0 (header line 2 now carries that signal) but the docs table still listed it.
- **`SESSION` explanation** now documents the `output` ratio line (added in 1.4.0) and removes the reference to a `last` field that was never in that section.

### Security
- **`.github/dependabot.yml` added.** Weekly schedule on `github-actions` ecosystem — opens a PR whenever a pinned-by-SHA Action has a newer release. Keeps the supply-chain hardening fresh without manual maintenance burden. The PR updates both the SHA and the inline version comment in a single diff, so reviewers see exactly what changed.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- **`AGENT-PROTOCOL.md`** — bundled agent-facing protocol document specifying the handoff file schema (7 sections), filename convention (`./handoff-{shortId}.md`), exact request-to-clear phrasing, post-compaction fallback procedure, fresh-session bootstrap protocol, and handoff-vs-memory decision rubric. Installed into projects via the new `--install-protocol` flag; auto-loaded by the agent through `CLAUDE.md` `@import`.
- **`protocol.mjs`** — new module providing `emitProtocol()`, `installProtocol()`, `uninstallProtocol()` with atomic write semantics and idempotent install.
- **`--emit-agent-protocol`, `--install-protocol`, `--uninstall-protocol` CLI flags.** Combined setup: `npx agent-token-meter --install-hooks --install-protocol`.
- **Multi-event hook registration.** `--install-hooks` now registers handlers for `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, and `PostCompact` — not just `PostToolUse`. The hook script dispatches on `payload.hook_event_name`.
- **`SessionStart` bootstrap nudge.** When a new session starts in a project containing a recent `./handoff-*.md`, the hook emits a one-line read-this-first reminder. Fires once per session.
- **`PostCompact` explicit nudge.** When Claude Code fires the explicit compaction event, the hook emits an immediate fresh-handoff instruction. Suppresses the legacy heuristic detection for 60s to prevent double-firing.
- **`CREDITS.md`** with full citations for Gary Capps' *The Hidden Constraint in LLM Systems* (May 2026), Liu et al. 2023 (*Lost in the Middle*, arXiv 2307.03172), Hsieh et al. 2024 (*RULER*, arXiv 2404.06654), Modarressi et al. 2025 (*NoLiMa*, arXiv 2502.05167), and an acknowledgment of Anthropic's platform prior art (Claude Code, session JSONL format, hook architecture, prompt caching).
- **`the-hidden-constraint.md`** shipped as an official reference doc in the npm tarball with the author's permission.
- **Reasoning-zone bands** on the dashboard. The multiplier line now carries a `[SHARP]`, `[SOFTENING]`, `[DRIFT]`, `[TOLERANCE]`, or `[OVER]` tag derived from `contextPct`, displayed alongside the cost-based multiplier color.
- **Two-axis phase banner.** Now reads `fill N% (overhead M%)` — exposing both the budget signal (fill) and the drift signal (overhead) without conflating them.
- **Page-equivalent on the context line.** Shows e.g. `78% · 12 pages [DRIFT]`. Conversion: ~750 tokens/page (mixed prose+code midpoint).
- **Visual context bar** with zone-tinted fill (30 cells).
- **`WHAT TO HANDOFF` widget** appears during HANDOFF/RESET phases — a 5-item primer mirroring the protocol's handoff schema.
- **Post-compaction annotation** in the NOW section (`NOW (post-compaction × 1)`).
- **Output-vs-input ratio** in the SESSION section with a verbose-agent warning when output exceeds 3% of inputs — surfaces Gary Capps' "generated output competes for the same reasoning budget" insight.
- **README "Agent Protocol" section** explaining the contract, install commands, and end-to-end workflow.
- **README "Composing with Claude Code's memory system" appendix** documenting the architectural parallel (within-session handoff vs. across-session memory).

### Changed
- **Thesis-aligned copy across every customer-facing surface.** The 50/75/90% thresholds are framed as *reasoning-degradation milestones*, not budget alarms. Curation is still cheap at 50%, drift sets in at 75%, attention is degraded and cost is biting at 90%.
- **Hook nudge strings include the concrete handoff filename** via `${shortId}` substitution. The 90% nudge contains the literal phrase the agent should say to the user.
- **Compaction nudge** now reads *"Position bias reset to fresh; thresholds re-armed. Write a fresh ./handoff-${shortId}.md now — the auto-summary is a fallback, not a substitute."*
- **README "Why short sessions win" section** rewritten around the *retrieval reach vs. active reasoning workspace* distinction (from Gary Capps' article). Adds the *output competes for budget* and *dependency density matters* points. Closes with the *competence zone vs. tolerance zone* heuristic.
- **`IF YOU CLEAR` section** now triggers on cost savings **OR** reasoning-zone DRIFT/TOLERANCE — surfaces guidance even when cost is low but attention is degraded. When attention-triggered, adds a `reasoning DRIFT → SHARP` line.
- **`installHooks` / `uninstallHooks`** sweep all registered event keys, not just one.
- **npm package description** rewritten to lead with the value prop instead of a feature list.

### Security
- **GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs.** `ci.yml` and `publish.yml` now reference `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` by their full commit SHA with a version-tag comment, instead of by mutable tag. A compromise of an upstream Action's tag cannot reach our publish workflow until we explicitly review and update the pinned SHA.
- **Signed git tags for releases.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents `npm version --sign-git-tag` as the release-cut convention. Combined with the existing SLSA provenance attestation, releases now have an end-to-end signed chain: maintainer-signed tag → CI verifies tag matches `package.json` → npm publish provenance ties the tarball to the commit. Consumers verify both via `git tag --verify v<x.y.z>` and `npm audit signatures`.
- **`CODEOWNERS` file added** at `.github/CODEOWNERS` — gives reviewers and supply-chain scanners a verifiable maintainer signal.
- **`SECURITY.md` expanded** to enumerate every filesystem path the tool reads or writes, with the trigger flag for each write. Out-of-scope writes are now an explicit security bug. The supply-chain hardening section documents the SHA-pin / signed-tag / provenance chain end-to-end.

### Why
Two threads converged: (1) sharpening the public framing around quadratic cumulative cost and U-shaped attention reasoning degradation, and (2) closing the gap between *agent-readable signal* (already good in v1.3) and *agent-driven workflow* (was missing — agent had to improvise the handoff). v1.4 makes the "AGENT" in agent-token-meter fully earned: the agent receives a protocol document, knows the schema and filename, knows what to tell the human at 90%, and the next session bootstraps from the handoff automatically.

The supply-chain hardening is independent of the agent-protocol work but shipped in the same release because it's small and load-bearing for trust: Socket.dev's supply-chain score, `npm audit signatures` verification, and downstream consumers all benefit from the tighter posture.

No behavior change to read-only telemetry, session-file watching, or the cost-multiplier math. Threshold percentages and compaction-detection heuristics unchanged.

## [1.2.5] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `SECURITY.md` with a private-disclosure policy, scope statement, verification instructions (`npm audit signatures`), and a summary of the package's security posture.
- README badges for monthly downloads, signed provenance (linking to `SECURITY.md#verifying-a-release`), and zero dependencies.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-04-22

### Security
- **Atomic settings.json writes.** Hook install/uninstall now writes to `settings.json.tmp` and renames into place, preventing concurrent-write clobbering if Claude Code is editing `~/.claude/settings.json` at the same moment. Same-directory rename is atomic on both Windows and POSIX.
- **Exact-path hook matching.** Install/uninstall now identifies token-meter entries by the installed hook filename (`token-meter-hook.mjs`) instead of a loose `"token-meter"` substring match. Closes a silent-deletion edge case where an unrelated user hook containing the string "token-meter" could be removed on uninstall.

### Infrastructure
- **Publish via GitHub Actions with SLSA provenance.** Releases now trigger on a `v*` tag push; the `publish.yml` workflow authenticates via a repo secret and calls `npm publish --provenance`, attaching a signed attestation tying each tarball to its source commit. Consumers can verify via `npm audit signatures`. No npm tokens ever touch local machines, chat, or documentation during a release. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the one-time setup.

### Changed
- `VERSION` now reads from `package.json` at runtime instead of being a separately-maintained constant — single source of truth, no drift.

## [1.2.3] — 2026-04-22

### Documentation
- README documents the 1.2.2 session-rollover hint: new row in the startup-slides table and a dedicated "Session rollovers" subsection explaining when the slide fires, why the meter reports per-segment instead of aggregating across `.jsonl` files, and how to pivot between segments via `--sessions` / `--session` / `--all`.

## [1.2.2] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- Session-rollover hint. When Claude Code opens a fresh `.jsonl` on `/resume` or a new `claude` invocation in the same cwd, the meter now surfaces a startup slide like `new session segment · prior fa7a76de (2.8MB, 26m ago) · metrics cover this segment only` whenever the current file has ≤5 user turns and a substantial prior `.jsonl` exists in the same project dir. Prevents a long, rolled-over conversation from reading as a short one.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Header no longer overflows the 60-char UI width. Split into two lines: agent identity on line 1, project directory + short session id on line 2.
- Dashboard no longer duplicates into terminal scrollback on refresh. Switched to the alt-screen buffer (`\x1b[?1049h`) — the same technique `vim` and `less` use. Exiting the meter cleanly restores your original terminal contents.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Default session scope is now the current working directory.** Launching the meter in terminal A only watches sessions for that project, never a newer one from terminal B in a different repo. Auto-follow still switches between sessions, but only inside the same project. Use `--all-projects` to restore the pre-1.2 machine-wide behavior.
- Dashboard header now shows the Claude Code project directory alongside the short session id — the primary signal for matching the numbers to a specific terminal by eye.
- Startup notice replaced with a slide queue: 2–4 slides (each ~4–5s) explaining scope, follow mode, and escape hatches. Rendered at the bottom so the numbers above never shift when slides fade.

### Added
- `--all-projects` flag to watch any session machine-wide.
- Parent-watchdog: the meter polls `process.ppid` every 5 seconds and self-exits when the launching shell dies. Fixes the Windows orphan-process leak where killing the `npx` wrapper left the grandchild `node.exe` running forever.
- Fallback notice when launched from a directory with no matching Claude Code project: falls back to global scan and warns.

### Fixed
- Multiplier in `--sessions` output now displays as `×8.1` instead of the raw float `×8.148956277621814`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- Per-call cost multiplier (`×N.N`) as the dashboard headline — shows how much each call costs vs. a fresh-conversation call.
- Phase banner fusing workflow phase, context fill %, and compaction ETA into one scannable sentence.
- Support for Opus 4.7 pricing and context limits.
- Multi-instance auto-follow: the meter switches to whichever Claude Code session is most recently active when the current one has been idle for 30+ seconds.

### Changed
- Decluttered dashboard layout into three labeled zones: NOW, IF YOU CLEAR, SESSION.
- Multiplier now uses one decimal place for sub-integer precision.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Corrected npm README screenshot path.
- Normalized `package.json`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04

### Added
- Initial public release. Live burn-rate dashboard, cost tracking, multi-provider comparison, compaction detection, threshold hooks.
- Support for Claude Code via `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL logs.
- `--install-hooks` / `--uninstall-hooks` for in-context threshold nudges at 50/75/90%.
